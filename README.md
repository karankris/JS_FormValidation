# My JavaScript Learning Repository 

Welcome to my repository where I'm learning JavaScript.

## Introduction

In this repository, I will be documenting my journey as I learn JavaScript. This includes code samples which I work on to improve my skills.

## Form Validation
### Topics covered in progress-1 (27-09-2023)

- Email validation using regexp(regular expression) format.
- PhoneNo validation using regex format.
- Password and ConfirmPassword using If-Else and Relational operators.
  
## Note
     Folder named as Javascript for progress-1 and the javascript code is done in the same html file using script tag.
     From progress-2 there will be seperate js file for Javascript code
     
### Topics covered in progress-2 (29-09-2023)
- Username validation-1: Removal of white space in the beginning and in end of the input by using `trim()` function.
- Username validation-2: Username should be more than two characters or entites it is verified by using `length` function.

### Topics covered in progress-3 (30-09-2023)
   I have Learnt some of the String built-in functions :
- **`Split()`** : The function which i have used in my code efficiently divides a given string based on the whitespace characters, allowing you to extract and manipulate individual elements of the input text.

        Example: Username=Karan R
        Function used = Username.split(" ")
        result = ["Karan", "R"]
          In the provided example, the Split(" ") function splits the input string into a list of words, with each word as a separate 
          element. This can be immensely useful in various scenarios, such as text processing, parsing, and data extraction.
  
- **`tolowerCase(),toUpperCase()`** : Both functions are used to convert to lower and upper case respectively.
- **`replace()`** :is an inbuilt method in JavaScript that is used to replace a part of the given string with another string.


### Topics covered in progress-4 (04-10-2023)
  In this directory, it consistes of various programs using for loop and some of the new build-in functions which i have learnt:
  
  - Find odd or even number in a given range using for loop
  - Find regional and non-regional language from a given array
  - **`indexOF()`** Find the dupicate and orginal elements from a given array . `indexOf()` function which is used to write the conditions based upon the index of an array. 
  - **`includes()`** Find the dupicate and orginal elements from a given array. `includes()` function which is used to make the condtion based upon the boolean values (**True/Flase**).
  - **`push & pop`** It is used in the programs to add or remove any element from the given array based upon the user-defined condition's.
